# Our Work

We're making a multi-class classification model to detect various Indonesian traditional foods.
Overall, there are already 8 classes we've trained:
1. Rendang
2. Putu Ayu
3. Bika Ambon
4. Pie Susu
5. Mochi
6. Kerak Telur
7. Pempek
8. Lapis Talas Bogor

Each class consist of 120 images that we split into 3 section: train, validation, and test.

# Tools We Used

- Python
- Tensorflow
- CutMix Generator
- Google Colab
- VGG-19 pre-trained Model

# Run Our Model

- Costum Your Own Model
You need to clone our repo because it contains the dataset and also the model. After that you can costumize the directory according to your local/cloud repo.
you don't need to unzip the file because we've already put code to unzip it. Don't forget to install the pre-requirement (tensorflow) and finally you can use our model (we also already put the converter).

- Use Existing Model
There are 2 existed model on our repo that you can try. Go to the aimed saved_model folder and download the model. We provide several formats such as .tflite, .json, .h5, and .pb. For implementing on Android Studio you can choose the .tflite model.
